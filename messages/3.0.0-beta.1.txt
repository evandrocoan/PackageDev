v3.0.0-beta.1 (2017-07-08)
--------------------------

PackageDev now enters BETA *wheee*
(which doesn't really mean a lot for you, but anyway).

This latest release brings you:

+ A new syntax definition for settings files
+ Auto-completions for settings files (@deathaxe)
+ A tooltip showing the default and a description parsed from comments
  when hovering a settings key (@deathaxe)
+ Highlighting of settings keys that couldn't be found in any reference file
  (and were probably mis-spelled) (@deathaxe)

+ Completions for variables in syntax definitions

* Other minor changes and fixes
