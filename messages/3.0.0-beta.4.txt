v3.0.0-beta.4 (2017-08-31)
--------------------------

It's time for another **big** PackageDev update.
With this, we are nearing a release candidate (and stable release), since only few things are left
to do now.

This latest release brings you:

+ Completions of command names and arguments in all resource files that support them (@r-stein)

  This includes the JSON files as well as Python plugins!

* Rewrites of all relevant syntax definitions from tmLanguage to sublime-syntax
  (with the help of @r-stein)

  Now with very precise highlighting for:

  - build systems
  - commands files
  - completions files
  - macro files
  - menu files (new!)
  - mousemap files

  Additionally, snippets and completions (within strings) were added wherever they made sense.

* Unified "New *" command with more templates for more resource file types
+ Suggests to create this file in the current project, if it is a package
* Supportive deprecation warnings in tmPreferences files when Sublime Text wouldn't pick up a
  string's content after a comment or CDATA tag (@keith-hall)
* Settings completions fixes and improvements (with help from @deathaxe)
* Various other fixes
