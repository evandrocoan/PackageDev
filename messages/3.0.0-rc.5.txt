v3.0.0-rc.5 (2017-09-06)
------------------------

This will hopefully be the final release candidate.

Changes since the last notes:

+ Added symbol definitions to a couple syntaxes for faster browsing (Ctrl+R)
+ Show warning when working with tabs in a syntax test file

* Improved "New *" resource file commands (insert package name, default file name, added menu)
* Fixed phantoms in side-by-side-settings
* Better completions for scope names in syntax definitions (re-opens automatically)
* Various other fixes (syntaxes, settings insertions)
