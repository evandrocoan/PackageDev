v3.0.0 (2017-09-09)
-------------------

Congratulations on receiving the biggest update of PackageDev to date!

After almost a year in the making,
doubling the amount of commits
and a couple helpful contributors,
I am pleased to announce that PackageDev
has finally been completely updated to the Next Generation
(which is Sublime Text 3).
As such, this release is the first not to support ST2,
which has essentially been EOLed years ago.
The old version still remains installable and usable, however.

I tried to keep the changelog to a minimum
without leaving up the important stuff,
so please bear with me.

First of all, many thanks to the [contributors][]
@deathaxe, @r-stein, @keith-hall and @Thom1729.
Because of how aggregated this changelog is,
it isn't feasible to attribute them to the respective features they added.

## Actual Changelog

+ *All* syntax definitions have been rewritten from scratch
  in the new .sublime-syntax format (excluding `*-tmLanguage` syntaxes).

  As a result, all file paths to the syntax definitions have changed
  and you may have to re-set or re-open any files using them.

  In the process, all snippets and completions have been updated
  and more have been added,
  including auto-completions for all available commands
  and their arguments.

  Entirely new syntax definitions have been added for:

  - new syntax definition files
  - menu files
  - project files
  - tmPreferences files (and generic property lists)

+ Settings are linted, have auto-completion and helpful tooltips.

  Settings descriptions and possible values
  are parsed from a setting's comment,
  as long as the package provides one.

  Side-by-side settings also have quick link for editing them.

+ New and intelligent templates for old and new resource files.

  With a package's folder added to a project,
  open the command palette with `PackageDev: New`.

+ Some goodies for writing syntax tests:

  - Completions of scope selectors
  - Highlighting of the region that is being tested with the current line
  - Automatic assignment of the specified syntax

+ A new command to create a package: `PackageDev: Create Package`

* All commands have been renamed to include the `packagedev_` prefix.

  Remember to update your key bindings, if you have any.

* Other various fixes or tweaks


Happy developing
