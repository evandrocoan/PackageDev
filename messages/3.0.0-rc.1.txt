v3.0.0-rc.1 (2017-09-01)
------------------------

With the first release candidate we're nearing the stable release even further.
This latest release can be considered feature-complete and only bugfixes will be incorporated now.

This time we have:

+ A new syntax for project files (with key name and settings completions and all that)
+ A command to create a new package
* Fixed settings linting, popups and completions due to syntax update in last release
* Other fixes
